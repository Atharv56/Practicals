                        ava  has  been  one  of  the  most  popularprogramming  language  for  many  years.  Java  is  Object  Oriented.  However,  it  is  notconsidered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (likeint, char, etc) The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independentcode).  Then  the  byte  code  is  run  on  Java  Virtual  Machine  (JVM)  regardless  of  theunderlyingarchitecture.
